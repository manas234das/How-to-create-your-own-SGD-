# Simple Linear Regression Implementation

A python implementation of linear regression from scratch.
Created the Linear regression library from scratch and coded the entire optimization equation from scratch.

This notebook illustrates the nature of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and walks through all the necessary steps to create SGD from scratch in Python. Gradient Descent is an essential part of many machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. To understand how it works you will need some basic math and logical thinking. Though a stronger math background would be preferable to understand derivatives, I will try to explain them as simple as possible.

## Objective:
The goal is to create the SGD for the Linear regression from scratch.

## Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries before running this project.
1. Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and scipy: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Getting Started
Start by downloading the project files and run the ".ipynb" file as a ipython-notebook (Jupyter notebook)

## Requirements

* Required libraries are:
	- scikit-learn
	- numpy
	- pandas
	- matplotlib
	- nltk
	- python >= 3.7
	- Check the notebooks for more details
